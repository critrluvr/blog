<p>It's an Ibanez Mikro! I felt like I should get a short scale to start because I have puny hands. I'm having so much fun learning the songs I've always loved. I made a <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFYJQTY_3J7pJV4ZJ0mWTnpk8UNVwTbC3&si=02WYIOOn9wAhfRaT" target="_blank">playlist on YouTube</a> of the ones I'm especially interested in. I figured out how to tune it myself with the Universal Tuner app on Android, and I'm mainly using YouTube, Songsterr, and Ultimate Guitar to learn songs. It feels so good to actually play music I like. I think this is why I didn't stick with violin. I just didn't listen to violin! But, with this it's different. I love bass-heavy genres like Disco, Funk, and Rock, and it's just much more pleasant to noodle with this instrument. I love my wittle bass fwiend!</p>
