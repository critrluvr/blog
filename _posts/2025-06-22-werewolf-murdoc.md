excerpt: "So I got back into Gorillaz and fell in love with the demonic lizard goblin Murdoc lol. I love his fringe. Doodled him as a werewolf because why not? He's cool like that. He's got the weird vampire thing going on, too, like Erik from <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>, which is another one of my interests. Like c'mon I wasn't gonna not notice all those goofy Nosferatu references and not catch feels. I'd also like to do some kind of crossover with Murdoc and Erik. There's quite a few things they have in common even though their personalities are foils (although Erik has a mischievious side). <em>Phantom</em> is a gothic novel, and there are a LOT of gothic references in Murdoc's story. I won't go into it right now because the list is quite long. I'll maybe make a post about it later on Tumblr and then add it here."
