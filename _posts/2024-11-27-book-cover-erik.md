excerpt: "I wanted to draw the Erik from <a href='https://phantomoftheopera.fandom.com/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera?file=Cover.jpg' target='_blank'>the original cover painted by André Castaigne</a> on <em>The Phantom of the Opera</em> by Gaston Leroux with some changes, mainly his hat and his mask, to match the text a little closer. I prefer a smiling Erik over the more melancholy depictions."
