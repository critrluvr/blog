excerpt: "I'm addicted to Ty Beanie Babies! This here is Hyacinth. She was the last of her kind when I saved her from a CVS. She's got a little defect under her right eye, but it just makes her more unique. My hair ties kinda work like cute little collars for my beanies. I really like pink and purple, if you couldn't already tell."
